# gsc-sabermetrics
 a funny idea with poor execution. still a neat way to practice some stuff in python i guess.  
 in any case, the analysis scripts are copy-pasted to hell and don't even test what their file names imply they do anymore.  
 This was never a proper project and, once more, just a fuck-around sandbox.
